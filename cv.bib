  abstract = {Materials combining strong ferromagnetism and good semiconducting properties are highly desirable for spintronic applications (e.g., in spin-filtering devices). In this work, we conduct a search for concentrated ferromagnetic semiconductors through high-throughput computational screening. Our screening reveals the limited availability of semiconductors combining ferromagnetism and a low effective mass. We identify the manganese pyrochlore oxide In2Mn2O7 as especially promising for spin transport as it combines low electron effective mass (0.29 m0), a large exchange splitting of the conduction band (1.1 eV), stability in air, and a Curie temperature (about 130 K) among the highest of concentrated ferromagnetic semiconductors. We rationalise the high performance of In2Mn2O7 by the unique combination of a pyrochlore lattice favouring ferromagnetism with an adequate alignment of O-2p, Mn-3d, and In-5s forming a dispersive conduction band while enhancing the Curie temperature.},

  abstract     = {The fundamental thermodynamic driving forces beyond the existence of high entropy alloys (HEAs) are still not firmly understood. Here, using thermodynamic modeling combining ab initio computations with a regular solution model, we build a database of more than 100,000 BCC and FCC equimolar alloys formed using 27 common elements. We statistically study how enthalpic and entropic contributions evolve with the number of elements in a random solid solution. The commonly admitted rationalization of a stabilization of HEAs due to a growing importance of the entropy with the number of elements is somewhat contradicted. Entropic and enthalpic contributions favor mixing in average, but both driving forces weaken as the number of elements in the alloy increases. By adding binary intermetallics to our analysis, we conclude that the specific chemical compositions prone to form single phase HEAs need to combine an enthalpically favorable mixing of their elements on a given lattice with the absence of strongly competing intermetallics.},
